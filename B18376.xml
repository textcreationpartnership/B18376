            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

In the manage of this employment, I have not loaded the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with the guilt of so many <hi>Monsters, Beasts,</hi> and <hi>Evil Members,</hi> as others who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten before me have done; but rather care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully have endeavoured to lay upon every Horse His own burthen; and so to carry my candle, as to give light unto no mans evil Deeds, any farther then as it receives light from God's Holy word.

<pb facs="tcp:204201:4"/> of Those <hi>Two famous branches of God's Olive-trees,</hi> in these papers mentioned, which were cut down, and yet have sprouted and put forth again.

And under Your pressures, (God be praised) the light of that holy Oyl which fell from Your boughs, hath shon so much the brighter.

            <p>YOu are to understand, that these Notes conceived and written in 86, laboured for the Light: But the harshness of those times not admitting of <hi>License;</hi> (witness the Epistle before Dr. <hi>Woodruff</hi>'s Treatise upon the same Subject:) Whence the Author's Care to advance Truth, and Zeal to expel <hi>Popish Darkness,</hi> striving against the <hi>Stream,</hi> to get Impression, and not able to work by skill without hands, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to use hands without eyes; and working in the Dark, no wonder you meet with some Letters Turn'd, and others superabundant, or mistaken, or changed, and perhaps a Sylable swelled,
<pb facs="tcp:204201:5"/> or disordered, and once a whole Line twice repeated, and here and there some disjoynted, or ill joynted words. The Author claims not to be without Error, but most of the Escapes are for want of better means, which after four or five times Corrected and Revised, yet still slippt off. The worst is the <hi>Introduction</hi> and the following <hi>Chapters;</hi> but after the hand in the work mended, it was the VII Chapter begun; when the <hi>Sun</hi> yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding light, and free License gained, you enjoy a more Correct Copy.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>WHereas, many Authors without effectual success, have written of this Subject, (although the Mysteries writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten off, were never published by the Holy Ghost, with a purpose utterly to be buried in obscurity:) And having by me the advantage of other mens failings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Their Miscarriages, and the reason thereof, do visibly appear unto me; and the benefit of Time daily advancing more and more <hi>towards that end</hi> spoken of in <hi>Daniel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 12.4.</note> wherein the clearer light of all obscure Prophesies shall be revealed. In confidence of these helps, and of (what is most of all) the assistance of <hi>God's good spirit,</hi> and blessing upon my candid endeavours, I have also undertaken to add the <hi>mite of my weak Reasonings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lu. 21.1, 2.</note> to be cast into the <hi>Treasury</hi> of what is gone before.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:204201:6"/>
            <p>I humbly conceive, I have not here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to my <hi>Readers</hi> view, a confused notion of the <hi>Visions</hi> herein undertaken to be explained; but rather that I have composed such a scheme of the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> (so far as is undertaken) as no <hi>Reader</hi> well verst <hi>in History,</hi> and <hi>in Scripture</hi> Reasonings, shall reasonably refuse to close with. All Texts of Scripture herein opened, have their Vouchees, which confirm the sense and meaning offered; One Text witness<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for another, and that so, as they all agree together in their Testimony, as to the sense of the mater proposed, without contrariance, or contradiction. All <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> thereof, so far as they are of Times and Things perfectly past, are distributed each unto their proper story, and that so plain, full, and easily cohoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thereto, that each owns its fellow; as it were many keys every one claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its proper lock, or as so many swords, owning all of them their proper scabbards. And the <hi>whole Prophecy</hi> so fitly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>responds with <hi>all its parts,</hi> that every <hi>part</hi> of <hi>Prophecy</hi> being grafted into its proper place, the joints thereof suit so well together, that the whole seemeth as it were one entire natural body. And all
<pb facs="tcp:204201:6"/> the <hi>Visions</hi> in the whole Prophecy do so suit, and correspond together, as the <hi>Times yet to come,</hi> do also sit in so plainly and effectually, and are so firmly ascertained, as otherwise cannot well fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but are to happen in such a necessary order, as cannot aptly be avoided.</p>
            <p>The chief and main design of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, is to open and describe that Monster of Mankind, called the <hi>Beast which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose out of the sea.</hi> This <hi>Beast</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to demonstrate, to be understood <hi>wholly, properly,</hi> and <hi>only</hi> of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> which hath risen up out of the sometimes famous <hi>Church of Roma.</hi> This <hi>Papacy</hi> Reformed Christians have generally called <hi>Anti-christ;</hi> but of this name my method leadeth me not in, to treat of: And therefore of whom especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally meant, it's not in my way,<note place="margin">2 Joh. 7. 1 Joh. 2.18, 19.</note> at this time to make enquiry. There have been many <hi>Anti-christs</hi> in the <hi>Apostles</hi> time, and as many there may be again: And no doubt but in a sense the <hi>Pope</hi> may be called <hi>Anti-christ,</hi> and so may the <hi>Turkish Mufti;</hi> but who is<note n="*" place="margin">

Ch. 11.7.</note> The <hi>Beast of the Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Angel,</hi> and the <hi>Beast</hi> of the <hi>Bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Pit,</hi> I have undertaken to determine <hi>of whom</hi> They are to be understood, and that they are not at all significant of the <hi>Roman Papacy.</hi> There is also a grand <hi>Enemy of Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 19.20. Ch. 20.10.</note> called the <hi>False Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> and this also must be a <hi>Creature</hi> diverse from the <hi>Roman Beast:</hi> And perhaps may be the same with the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> and <hi>That wicked one,</hi> and the <hi>Little Horn</hi> in <hi>Daniel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 7, 8.</note> and the <hi>Beast of the Earth,</hi> of the <hi>Apostle.</hi> But This <hi>Beast out of the Sea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 17.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> and the <hi>Great Whore His Rider,</hi> are singularly, and only properly significant of the <hi>Papacy;</hi> and cannot be spoken properly under all its qualifications, of any <hi>Person, Power,</hi> or <hi>Thing</hi> besides.</p>
            <p>Now for sure proof, that <hi>this Beast,</hi> and <hi>This great Whore,</hi> are to be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood as I have undertaken to say, and not otherwise, the <hi>fourth Chapter</hi> of this ensuing Treatise undertakes to evince. But what is to be understood by the <hi>Sea,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:204201:7"/> is demonstrated in <hi>Chapter the III. §. VI.</hi> And how the <hi>Beast,</hi> the <hi>Papacy of Roma</hi> did according to story arise out of the <hi>Sea,</hi> and healed the deadly wound, the <hi>V. Chapter</hi> doth shew, in the <hi>four first Sections thereof.</hi> And from thence forwards in three <hi>large Sections</hi> is set forth the whole History of the <hi>Papacy,</hi> called the <hi>Beast out of the Sea,</hi> from <hi>Hadrian and Pope Leo the III.</hi> about the year of <hi>Christ, 800,</hi> unto this present, for about <hi>900</hi> years. All which story is collected out of <hi>Popish Authors,</hi> Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and allowed by the <hi>Papal</hi> authority, excepting only that as we enter into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern story, which is as yet rife in our Grandsir's memories, we have taken in such Authors, as being of good reputation came readilyest to our hadns. The <hi>Beast</hi> being thus distinguished by his known and sure marks, and after that, those marks plainly and clearly confirmed by the Story at large. In the <hi>VII. Chapter</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed such qualifications, as by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are expresly spoken of this <hi>Beast,</hi> whence unavoidably will follow,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That be it so, that the <hi>Papacy of Roma</hi> from about the year <hi>800,</hi> was infallibly signified by the <hi>Beast of the Sea;</hi> and that by <hi>seven several marks,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:204201:8"/> the same thing is demonstrated, beyond all peradventure. Then what need we any farther dispute about the <hi>Pope's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi> or the <hi>worship of Images,</hi> or of Their <hi>Idolizing the bread of the Sacrament,</hi> or whether the <hi>Romans</hi> be the <hi>true Church?</hi> For the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> hath expresly decided the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, who peremptorily hath demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated by infallible tokens, that the <hi>Great Whore</hi> is significant of the <hi>Pope of Roma,</hi> and <hi>His Church;</hi> and if so, then follows it, that the <hi>same Church</hi> is a <hi>Great Whore,</hi> and if so, a <hi>Corrupt Church,</hi> a <hi>false Church,</hi> and therefore <hi>Schismatical, Heretical,</hi> and an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statised</hi> Church, and <hi>none of Christ's.</hi> Moreover the Holy Ghost chargeth this <hi>Beast,</hi> and this <hi>Whore,</hi> with most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <hi>Blasphemies, Idolatries, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Cruelties, Sacrileges,</hi> and most abominable insolencies, against the <hi>Lamb</hi> and His <hi>followers:</hi> And both the <hi>Beast</hi> and the <hi>Whore</hi> being significant of the <hi>papacy</hi> and the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> that <hi>papacy</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> are by consequence, expresly charged under the name of the <hi>Beast</hi> and the <hi>Whore,</hi> with all those abominations. And if so, then the Holy Ghost hath determined all Disputes. And
<pb facs="tcp:204201:8"/> in stead of an <hi>Infallible Church,</hi> hath sentenced the <hi>Papacy</hi> and its <hi>Church</hi> to be a <hi>false Whore.</hi> And charging Her with <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>spiritual whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> either this must consist in Her <hi>worshipping of Images,</hi> and of the <hi>Bread and Wine</hi> in the Sacrament, or in something else as bad. And charging Her with <hi>Blasphemies;</hi> either those must lye in Her Blasphemous <hi>Titles of Honour,</hi> or Her blasphemous <hi>Doctrines,</hi> or blasphemous <hi>Indulgences,</hi> or in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else as bad. And charging Her with the <hi>bloud of the Saints;</hi> either this must be the bloud of the <hi>Waldists,</hi> or <hi>Husites,</hi> or <hi>Lollards;</hi> or of the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacree of <hi>Paris,</hi> or of <hi>Cranmer, Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Rildy, Hooper,</hi> and Their fellows, in Queen <hi>Marys</hi> days,; or of some other <hi>Protestants,</hi> or of all of Them. And this being the charge of the Holy Ghost, let them clear themselves as They can!</p>
            <p>Now by way of <hi>Introduction</hi> to these things, is described the Kingdom of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> and what is meant of that Dragon, and how the <hi>same Beast with seven heads,</hi> did carry the <hi>Dragon</hi> in one Head, and the <hi>Beast</hi> in another. As the first Chapter shews in the four first Sections. And the <hi>sixth Section</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
<pb facs="tcp:204201:9"/> what is meant by that <hi>Heaven</hi> where the <hi>Dragon</hi> was, and also the <hi>Woman.</hi> And how the <hi>Dragon perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted</hi> that <hi>Woman,</hi> and was finally cast out of Heaven, the seven and eight Sections do describe. After this, the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> cast out into the <hi>Earth,</hi> are descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the <hi>Triumphs of the Church</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, in Chapter the third, and Section the first. Also, what is to be understood by the <hi>men of the Earth,</hi> and how those <hi>Earthly men,</hi> and principally the <hi>Angel of the Bottomless Pit,</hi> did <hi>drive the Woman into the Wilderness,</hi> doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the residue of that Chapter. And from these Men of the <hi>Earth,</hi> how the Devil set up the <hi>kingdom of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> in the <hi>Sea;</hi> and how the deadly <hi>wound</hi> of that <hi>Dragon</hi> was healed by the <hi>Rise of the Beast out of the Sea,</hi> is that which hath been shewed afore, as the body, or main design of this Treatise. And now in the discussing of these matters, we have occasion to treat of several other Monsters, such as are the Angel of the <hi>Bottomless Pit,</hi> and the Beast of the <hi>same Pit,</hi> and of the <hi>Earth;</hi> as also of the <hi>Two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> prophecying in <hi>Sack-cloath;</hi> and also of the seven <hi>Seals</hi> and seven <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,</hi> and as many <hi>Phials of God's wrath,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:204201:9"/> as things related to the <hi>Beast of the Sea,</hi> as to mater of dealing and business they had with him: Which things besides that they are mentioned promiscuously in their proper places of each Chapter, they are more especially treated on in the <hi>Praeface.</hi> Which being as it were an explanatory supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the rest of the Treatise, does Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatorily supply the <hi>Reader</hi> with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of such necessary <hi>Praecognitions,</hi> as being first rightly understood, do give so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much the clearer light to all what comes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Among these are especially mentioned <hi>Daniel's</hi> Prophetical Numbers, which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally explained by the <hi>Terms prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> and <hi>ensuing,</hi> do point directly at a certain point of Time <hi>when,</hi> and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, <hi>what</hi> then came to pass. Which things leading into the Prophecy of the <hi>Witnesses slain,</hi> do give great light unto the understanding of the Mysteries of the <hi>Seals,</hi> and of the <hi>Trumpets,</hi> and of the <hi>Beasts</hi> both of the <hi>Earth</hi> and of the <hi>Sea,</hi> and contribute much unto the answer of all objections of Authors, any whit thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Scheme of the Vision of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Beast,</hi> as may appear by my large <hi>Praeface.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, the <hi>VII.</hi> Chapter undertakes to treat of things to come, and opens the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:204201:10"/> of the <hi>forty two moneths</hi> time; that the <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>kingdom</hi> of the <hi>Papacy</hi> is to continue: And of the fall of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> at the end of those Moneths; and of the Order of that Fall by degrees; and of the <hi>three special Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners</hi> thereof: The establishment of an <hi>Heavenly and pure reformed Church.</hi> The Phial of wrath fallen on the <hi>men of the Earth,</hi> (which is even now in motion:) And the sounding the <hi>Trumpet</hi> by the <hi>seventh Angel,</hi> (which cannot be far off.) Herein also are opened the meaning of the <hi>seven Phials of God's wrath;</hi> in which is foreshewed, first the fall of the <hi>Popish Empire of Germany,</hi> signified by the <hi>second Phial of wrath</hi> poured forth: Secondly, the fall of the <hi>Popish kingdoms</hi> of <hi>France, Spain, Portugal, Savoy, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and others, signified by the <hi>third Phial</hi> falling upon Them: And thirdly, the fall of the <hi>pope himself,</hi> with all the Popish Potentates of <hi>Italia.</hi> All which things hasten to be accomplished; but as to the time when, I have named the very <hi>moneths</hi> of each fall; but the very day, I leave unto Him who knows all things, to determin. Unto whom be all honour and glory of all His works, for ever and ever.</p>

            </p>
            <p>A second Mystery was, that immediatly after the <hi>Church delivered,</hi>

                     </note> during the rule of three <hi>bloudy Persecutors;</hi> untill in the end the Church her selfe is to have the victory over all. These 3 Monsters were long since foreseene, and discovered by the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> and that long before any noise of them had been heard of in the world: And there, the three <hi>Monsters</hi> are all comprised under one name of a <hi>Dreadfull Beast, and exceeding strong, that had iron teeth, and with them brake in pieces, &amp; stamped upon the Remainder of the other Beasts with its feet, and it was diverse from all the Beasts that went before it; for it had ten Hornes, and a little Horne that sprung up from among them, before whom were three of the first Hornes pluk't up
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:204201:45"/> by the roots.</hi> Now, that this is the <hi>same Beast,</hi> which many yeares after appeared to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Apostle,</hi> &amp; that by him is called the <hi>Great Red Dragon,</hi> and the <hi>Beast</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> &amp; the other <hi>Beast</hi> of the <hi>Earth;</hi> is manifest by the tokens: for that the <hi>Ten Hornes</hi> of the One are the same with the <hi>Dragon,</hi> &amp; the <hi>One Beast</hi> of the other; and the <hi>little Horne</hi> here, agrees with the other <hi>Beast of the earth,</hi> that hath <hi>Two Hornes</hi> there. And besides, we are to consider the <hi>succession</hi> of the <hi>Beasts. Daniel</hi> was a Prophet of 600 years passed by, before <hi>St. John's</hi> time, who had seene in a vision three <hi>other Beasts</hi> before this, whereof the first was like a <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the second as a <hi>Bear,</hi> and the 3<seg rend="sup">d</seg>. had the forme of a <hi>Leopard:</hi> but this <hi>fourth</hi> was <hi>by far more Dreadfull</hi> than they all. Of these, <hi>Daniel</hi> had personal sight of the <hi>Lyon,</hi> going off, and of the <hi>Bear,</hi> comming on. And anon after <hi>Daniel</hi> diceased, came up the <hi>Leopard;</hi> whose reigne was long over, before <hi>St. Iohn</hi> was borne. And all these <hi>Three</hi> were gone by, &amp; as it were forgotten before our <hi>Divine Apostle's</hi> dayes. But no such monster as the <hi>fourth Beast, in Daniels</hi> Vision had ever beene knowne, before, &amp; until that, where of <hi>St. John</hi> spake, which had <hi>seven heads, &amp; ten Hornes;</hi>

                     <hi>and until that deadly wound was healed.</hi> Now these <hi>Heads</hi> had <hi>fallen, five times,</hi> and <hi>risen</hi> againe; and yet no <hi>Deadly</hi> wound was knowne. For tho King <hi>Tarquinius</hi> was cutt off, &amp; all His family, when the first head called <hi>Kingly power</hi> went downe; yet this was a wound only unto that family, but no wound unto the <hi>City,</hi> called the <hi>Beast:</hi> For <hi>Kingship</hi> layd aside, the <hi>Consuls</hi> ruled, and the <hi>Beast</hi> increased instrength &amp; growth as if there had been no change. And so also it happened at the Change of every head. But when <hi>the sixth Head,</hi> (which was after the <hi>Apostles time,) did fall;</hi> then was the <hi>Deadly wound,</hi> as by the Story appears: which happen'd as follows, very remarkea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. In the year of <hi>Christ</hi> 411, the <hi>Imperial City Roma</hi> was besieged, &amp; taken by <hi>Alari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> the <hi>Gothlander</hi> a Barbarous King, of the <hi>North,</hi> who cam boldly thoro all difficulties, from a farre Countrey, and by force entered that City which for all most a thousand yeares had beene the great Maistress of the world. <hi>Honorius</hi> a sleepy Prince was then Emperour, who thro slackness of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fell into this great default, to suffer so meane an enemie to approach so near Him. But the city being once beset, the famine with in oppressed as much as the Enemy with out, so as she was forced to yield, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:204201:66"/> at that time almost <hi>all Italy</hi> was brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. This was such a wound as <hi>Roma</hi> never felt before, no not when She was sack't by <hi>the Gaules</hi> in her younger years. And yet it proved not fatal, for that <hi>Alaricus</hi> dying in His victory, this storme was avoided, &amp; <hi>Roma</hi> recovered againe, and the Emperour <hi>Honorius</hi> reigned on. But 30 years after this, cam <hi>Attila</hi> King of the <hi>Hunns,</hi> and having greatly wasted all the <hi>Northerne Italia,</hi> He tooke the city <hi>Florentia</hi> by storme, &amp; ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly razed it unto the ground, &amp; had don as much to <hi>Roma,</hi> had not the wisdome of <hi>Leo</hi> then Bp. there, with good words diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Him. But <hi>Genserikus</hi> King of the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales,</hi> having first conquered <hi>Africa,</hi> came over into <hi>Italia,</hi> and slew <hi>Maximian</hi> the Usurping Emperour, &amp; tooke <hi>Roma</hi> by force, rifled, spoiled, &amp; burn't it, and led away captive <hi>Eudoxia</hi> the Empress, in the year of Christ 458. But like a storme, He only wasted the countrey, &amp; so retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For in those dayes the <hi>Easterne Empyre</hi> being formidable in power, these <hi>flashes of Conquest</hi> durst not abide the revenge, that from thence seemed to threaten. After this some years, <hi>Biorgus</hi> King of the <hi>Alanes</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by <hi>Trent,</hi> and wasted all the countrey until He was overcome. But with in two or three years after, about the year of Christ 467 came <hi>Odoacer</hi> King of the <hi>Herulans</hi> with an infinite number of people, &amp; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, &amp; destroyed <hi>Augustulus</hi> the last <hi>Emperour of Roma,</hi> and that so, as <hi>no more Emperour reigned there.</hi> And for 14 years
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:204201:67"/> He continued spoiling all <hi>Italia,</hi> and wrote Himselfe King thereof. Thus <hi>Roma</hi> had received many wounds, but this last was a <hi>deadly One;</hi> Her last Emperour being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, and an enemy writing Himselfe King <hi>of Italia:</hi> Her <hi>Empyre</hi> was now expy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. But as if this had not been enough, in the year 481 cam <hi>Theodorikus</hi> another <hi>Gothlander,</hi> and discomfited &amp; slew <hi>Odoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> tooke <hi>Roma,</hi> and made great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of people therein, and in all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey round about. And after all this, He reigned King <hi>of Italy</hi> 25 years, and his heirs after him: until <hi>Iustinian</hi> reigning at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, Belisarius</hi> once more brought <hi>Italy</hi> under subjection unto the <hi>Easterne Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre,</hi> yet so, as <hi>Ravenna,</hi> &amp; not <hi>Roma</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the seat of the <hi>Imperial</hi> substitute.

Now after this, the <hi>Gothes</hi> stirred no more, but incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating with the Natives, Their name became forgotten. But this healed not the deadly wound, for 16 years after the <hi>Goths</hi> stop't; there cam <hi>Alboinus</hi> King of the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobards,</hi> with a very great army, &amp; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite traine of women &amp; children, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, &amp; possessed all the whole countrey, from the <hi>Alpes,</hi> unto the mountaines of <hi>Apennine,</hi> and gave the name of <hi>Lumbardy</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:204201:67"/> unto that land, where He, &amp; his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors enjoyed, &amp; reigned about 213 years, from 566, unto the year of <hi>Christ</hi> 779, and during that whole while, were a strait bridle, and a sharpe curb, to keepe lowe the city of <hi>Roma,</hi> &amp; the Bishops thereof. Only the <hi>Easterne Emperour</hi> having a Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> made head against the <hi>Lumbards,</hi> &amp; becam a smal defence to stave off captivity; and yet ever &amp; anon, the <hi>Bishop,</hi> &amp; His <hi>Romans,</hi> were driven to crouch, and to petition, and to buy Their peace of these <hi>Lombards.</hi> And when at last <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> came to the rescue out of these dayly fears, he found <hi>Leo</hi> then <hi>Bishop of Roma</hi> oppressed by the factious citizens with in <hi>Roma;</hi> so as this <hi>Great Beast</hi> at that time, was as an old Lion ready to dye, &amp; gasping for breath, persecuted by the flyes, bitten of dogs, griped by ravenous birds, trod on by asses, &amp; spurned by the vilest creatures; and as it were wounded to death: &amp; yet then He revived.

                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Ch.</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.</note> from whence <hi>Persecution</hi> might come upon the <hi>Church;</hi> because of the <hi>woe pronunced</hi> to befal the <hi>Inhabiters of the Sea.</hi> And which this <hi>Beast of the Sea,</hi> is to bring about. By the <hi>Sea</hi> therefore, must be understood a people some way or other related unto great waters, and that plainly to be discerned; according to the acceptation of waters in holy writt. Now to these purposes we find, that as <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> are common meanes of <hi>Natural life,</hi> hence allegorikally in the scriptures they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:204201:69"/> are commonly taken for meanes of <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> &amp; <hi>Aeternal life,</hi> as it were the <hi>spiritual drinke of mens Souls.</hi> And to this purpose, the <hi>Word of God</hi> and <hi>divine knowledge</hi> are called <hi>Water.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezek</hi> 47:1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> As where it is said, <hi>Waters came running forth from under the Altar, and from thence, ran abroad, at first only ankle deepe, &amp; then knee deepe, and then up to the loynes, &amp; lastly so deepe as a river un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>passable, or waters where a man might swim.</hi> Now we know,<note place="margin">

And as appeares by the Vision; these <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Waters</hi> did flow, every age <hi>deeper,</hi> &amp; <hi>deeper,</hi> until they became very plentiful. As in another place it is said more plainly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hab.</hi> 2:14.</note> the <hi>Knowledge of the Lord shall become as the</hi> Watets <hi>that cover the</hi> Sea.

Now true it is, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:204201:74"/> some of these Kingdomes by times,<note place="margin">See the several: Chrons of each King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> were parcelled into <hi>many for one;</hi> as when in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were <hi>seven Kingdomes,</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> two, <hi>in Ireland</hi> four, in <hi>Spaine</hi> twelve. Yet in the maine time, each of these Countreys knew but <hi>one Monarchy,</hi> and therefore are esteemed but as One.

                     <hi>after the Apostles time?</hi> Yea it was so infallibly. The <hi>Apostle</hi> says it in plaine termes. And the concurrent testimony of all writers agrees thereto: that there were
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:204201:78"/> 7 sorts of <hi>Sovereigne</hi> ways of Government at <hi>Roma</hi> in practice, whereof <hi>that was the</hi> 6<seg rend="sup">th</seg>. and the 7<seg rend="sup">th</seg>. waited afterwards to take it's turne.

And was this too, to happen after the <hi>Deadly wound healed?</hi> Yea. The whole thing is plaine from the <hi>Apostles</hi> mouth, and by <hi>necessary Consequence;</hi> and the plaine &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable History of the times, expresses all passages how they fell out, even as was said.

And did They all arise nearly about the time as the sovereigne papacy began first to spring? Yea.

                  <p>N. 14. After <hi>Hadrian</hi> reigned <hi>Iohn the</hi> IX<seg rend="sup">th</seg>, whom most <hi>Roman</hi> writers called <hi>Iohn the</hi> VIII<seg rend="sup">th</seg>, because They would gladly have forgotten that <hi>She Pope</hi> who was <hi>Iohn the</hi> VIII<seg rend="sup">th</seg>, once before. But the honest <hi>Platina</hi> calls him <hi>Iohn the</hi> IX<seg rend="sup">th</seg>, whom there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore I justly follow. At entrance of his reigne, the Emperour <hi>Lodowik</hi> being trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously imprisoned by the Duke of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventum, did make oath upon condition of his release, to save harmeless the said duke, because of his treacherous act. But being at liberty <hi>Pope Iohn</hi> absolved him from his oath, because made of necessity,<note place="margin">Bzovius ad an: 872.</note> and left the Emperour at liberty for revenge, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witstanding his oath to the contrary,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his imprisonment.

But the sense of the <hi>Papacy</hi> is quite against the <hi>word of God:</hi> While <hi>His Holiness</hi> takes upon him to dispense with oaths, which God himselfe does not; and to absolve a man from his <hi>covenants</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the <hi>name of God,</hi> as if he had power over <hi>God Himselfe</hi> to command Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge; or at least had so great interest in <hi>God Almighty,</hi> that God is obliged also to pardon, where ever he absolves.

                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:204201:126"/> what he most desired to enjoy.

However <hi>Henry</hi> returning into <hi>Germany</hi> easily overcame these new troubles, <hi>Roma</hi> continuing all the while besieged.

During these things a treacherous plot was layd, to kill the <hi>Emperour</hi> in <hi>St. Marys</hi> Church, by a stone thrown down upon His head: but as it was in action, the man that should have done it, fell Himselfe thoro the hole,<note place="margin">Bzov. ad an, 1084.

But the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> leaving <hi>Roma</hi> to the <hi>Citizens</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (who were now sufficiently incensed against <hi>His Holiness</hi> so farre as to continue the siege after the <hi>Emperour,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pope Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> gone) returned into <hi>Germany.</hi> But then came <hi>Robert Guiscard, the Popes</hi> liegeman out of <hi>Apulia</hi> with his <hi>Norman</hi> army, and by the treachery of some false <hi>Romans,</hi> let into the

And the truth is, had those Great <hi>Popes</hi> been brought to the barre, as was this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable sneaks, there had been more then enough, to have deposed every one of them, as this man was. But then the <hi>Beast</hi> was in his pomp &amp; triumph; and now he is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling! And yet it is to be admired, by what
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:204201:179"/> authourity, these great men of the <hi>Council,</hi> who were sworne <hi>liege subjects</hi> unto his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Holiness; and had received <hi>Their Life</hi> from <hi>His breath;</hi> who had called them to <hi>Council,</hi> and had given Them all the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thourity They had: could notwithstanding judge, condemne, and dethrone Their Lord, &amp; Maker, as the worme in the fruit, does by the womb that bred it! Will They say They did it, by <hi>Imperiall</hi> authourity; that was not so: for it is against Their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to allege that; and besides <hi>not He,</hi> but the <hi>Pope called them,</hi> &amp; gave Them life; and as to mater of practice, it appears, the Emperour was but a Lackey unto the <hi>Pope,</hi> &amp; <hi>Council,</hi> who when <hi>John Hus</hi> was by them imprisoned, had neither au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thourity, nor power, nor interest enough with Them to make good his word, &amp; pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of free egress, &amp; regress, to release the prisoner. And if They had not <hi>Imperial</hi> authourity, whence then had they it? From <hi>Themselves?</hi> No. For how could that be? Could They give <hi>Themselves</hi> life, and power? Or were They <hi>Their own Council?</hi> No, They were neither <hi>Their Owne,</hi> nor the <hi>Emperours,</hi> but the <hi>Popish Council,</hi> and sat by his authourity. And he being deprived, Their authourity was also deprived. And was the <hi>head</hi> a corrupt thing, and could the body be pure? No, surely. They murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>John Hus,</hi> and <hi>Hierome of Prague</hi> for <hi>Heresie;</hi> and yet are guilty of rebellion against Their own lord. Loe therefore, to what a passe the <hi>Popish faith</hi> is come. They

                     <note place="margin">Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traei &amp; Thuani Historia.</note> and all the coasts thereabouts; complotted &amp; contrived, by the <hi>Popes,</hi> &amp; Their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, and executed by the <hi>Kings</hi> authouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Wherein 70000 reformed Christians in 24 hours space were wickedly butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:204201:195"/> without any Hearing, or any thing layd to Their charge, except that They were <hi>Christians,</hi> &amp; of the reformed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Such it seemes is the way of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Romish</hi> religion. But as <hi>Jacob,</hi> said of <hi>Simeon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Levi</hi> his sons, in a case like, but not so wicked as was this: So say I of this,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>[Instruments of Cruelty were in Their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations; O my Soul com not Thou into Their secret! Cursed be Their anger for it was fierce; and Their wrath, for it was cruel!]</hi> Fot They spared neither old, nor young, nor women in child bearing. And they spared not for any manner of treachery to bring Their maters about. Hence followed, that the then King of <hi>France,</hi> and his <hi>brother,</hi> and all of that race dyed without issue, and their name is perished. And yet <hi>Henry of Navarre,</hi> the next prince of the bloud, tho he had been better educated, and had tasted of the <hi>good word of God,</hi> and of his power in assistance, yet unhappily fell off unto this fowl religion! On the same year,<note place="margin">Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traeus.</note> the <hi>Neth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlanders</hi> of <hi>Belgia,</hi> having of long time hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred after an holy reformation; by the cruel oppressions of the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy there for the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into a warre, &amp; to stand upon their own defence. Whence followed a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there also. Now it happened that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these <hi>Reformations</hi> were not so regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, nor were they so well done as They ought to have been: Nor indeed as the case stood, was it aptly possible to have been otherwise. For the <hi>Clergy</hi> being allmost ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:204201:196"/> corrupted: Instructions were wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to say, what ought to have been done aright.<note place="margin">See §. 3. of this Ch.</note> And next the doctrine, &amp; practise of the <hi>Popish Church,</hi> had taught people, in case of <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Princes misgover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> to <hi>reform Themselves.</hi> And lastly things being done in hast, where was not roomth to consult &amp; deliberat, it could not avoid dropping into many irregularities. This Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> in his zeal to propagate the <hi>Roman</hi> faith established two colleges <hi>of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits</hi> in <hi>Roma,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Id.

Also he ayded all he could by his <hi>curses,</hi> and <hi>Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries,</hi> to foment the warrs both of <hi>France</hi> &amp; the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> against those of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fotmed religion. He celebrated <hi>a Jubilee</hi> at <hi>Roma</hi> in 1575, according to the custome of his predecessors, and the antient <hi>Pagans</hi> in <hi>Roma.</hi> He also excommunicated all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Hussites Wicklevists, Lutherans, Zuinglians, Calvinists, Hugonots, Ana<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>babtists,</hi> and all others <hi>dissenters</hi> from the Church of <hi>Roma;</hi> and all their abettors, and all who do or shal print or sell any of Their books: And he published a bul to that effect; which he commanded once by the year to be read in all Churches. <hi>Maximilian</hi> being dead</p>
                  <p>A. D. 1576. Rudolphus the II<seg rend="sup">d</seg>, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour the XXXVIII<seg rend="sup">th</seg>,</p>
                  <p>Was elected &amp; reigned in his stead. This
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:204201:196"/> Pope was a great promoter of Indulgences. At <hi>Siena,</hi> &amp; <hi>Padua,</hi> fore very <hi>mass said</hi> in one place, and for certaine numbers of <hi>ave ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp; Pater nosters, said</hi> in another place, or else for <hi>kissing the ground</hi> before the <hi>Altar of the sacrament:</hi> he made graunts of Souls to be freed out of <hi>purgatory,</hi> whom a man would himselfe. And in his time my authour being then at <hi>Roma</hi> remembers,<note place="margin">Sandys of the western religions.</note> that he saw there many <hi>Altars of Station,</hi> unto which were graunted <hi>perpetual Indulgences</hi> unto <hi>all men praying before Them</hi> indifferent for all times. And there were sundry <hi>Crosses,</hi> on the <hi>hard pavement engraven,</hi> in Their Churches, which had <hi>Indulgences annexed</hi> for <hi>every time They were kissed.</hi> Which as it seemes had been done so often, &amp; so very much, that the <hi>hard marble was worne with the multitude of soft kisses.</hi> This Pope also gave authourity to the new Calendar, brought unto him by <hi>Antonius Lilius M. D.</hi> and written by <hi>Aloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> brother to that <hi>Antony;</hi> whence it is called the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Gregorian Account;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was confirmed &amp; sett out by a Bul of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> for that purpose. Who after 13 years reigne was called to give up an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his stewardship. And</p>
                  <p>A. D. 1585. Sixtus the V<seg rend="sup">th</seg>, Pope the CXVII<seg rend="sup">th</seg>, </p>
                  <p>N. 36 Was elected. This man had been head of the <hi>Spanish Inquisition;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Onuphr.</note> and therefore wanted not for any manner of arts to let bloud, or to complot cruelties, against reformed Christians. This was he who set up the <hi>Liga Sancta,</hi> (as he called it,) wherein
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:204201:197"/> he, &amp; his confoederats obliged themselves by oath, to root out &amp; destroy <hi>all Protestants</hi> under pretence that they were <hi>Heretiks.</hi> And hence followed the attempts of the <hi>King of Spaine</hi> in 1588 against <hi>England.</hi> The Pope had bless 't the mighty navy of that prince, but it pleased God to curse it. Hence <hi>Henry of Guise</hi> with a great Confoederacy in <hi>France,</hi> carryed on most bloudy warrs for many years together against <hi>Henry of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi> and the reformed there. Hence <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the</hi> III<seg rend="sup">d</seg>, &amp; <hi>Henry the</hi> IV<seg rend="sup">th</seg>, <hi>French</hi> Kings were desperatly murdered. And hence endless plotts were contrived to kill quene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which it pleased God to prevent. This <hi>Pope</hi> also set out an edition of the Bible, which under paine of his curse he commanded to be used &amp; none else. But after 5 years he also march't off. And</p>

                  <p>N. 38. Was Elected and held all most one whole year.<note place="margin">Alstedii Thes. Chronol.</note> And then went he also the way of all flesh. And againe</p>

                  <p>N. 39. Was advanced unto the honour of the triple crowne; and did wear it for two moneths; and dropt away. Then</p>

                  <p>A. D. 1592. Clemens the VIII<seg rend="sup">th</seg>, Pope the CXXI<seg rend="sup">th</seg>, </p>
                  <p>N. 40. Followed <hi>Innocent.</hi> It shall seeme that many men being cut out for the <hi>Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> robes, They were faine to make hast to put them on &amp; off againe, that every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender might make his Essay. This <hi>Clemens</hi> revising the Bible sett out by his Predecessor <hi>Sixtus,</hi> found yet more faults still, in the translation; ahd therefore adventuring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the curse of <hi>Sixtus</hi> published a new Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with a new declaration, and a curse against all who use any Edition but that by him sett forth. And thus the Readers, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the paine of a curse; by <hi>Clemens,</hi> in case they read the Bible by <hi>Sixtus;</hi> and by <hi>Sixtus</hi> in case they read that of <hi>Clemens,</hi> or any other; seemed to be utterly beaten off from reading any at all. And no wonder, seeing that the <hi>Popish Church</hi> going about to hide the knowledge of the <hi>Bible;</hi> seemed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to favour the Synagogue of <hi>Sathan,</hi> by destroying the knowledge of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Now Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> had cursed the King of <hi>France</hi> because he was a profess't <hi>Hugonot.</hi> But the <hi>French Parliaments</hi> despising that curse, burnt it by the common hangman. But Pope <hi>Clemens</hi> with ayd of the <hi>Spanyards</hi> set up a new King against him. Whereupon <hi>Henry the</hi> IV<seg rend="sup">th</seg>. leaving religion, &amp; putting his confidence in <hi>Policy,</hi> becam a <hi>Roman Catholik.</hi> And by that meanes by reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe unto the Pope; lost his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest <hi>in God Almighty:</hi> Who having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected him from all attempts while he was
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:204201:198"/>
                     <hi>a Protestant:</hi> but then leaving him to his hazards, in 1610 he was by a Popish zealot stab't to death. And such was the effect of Confidence <hi>in Policy,</hi> more then in piety. <hi>Alphonso</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> dying without lawfull issue, the <hi>Pope</hi> seized on his Lands, &amp; left only two cities to his <hi>natural son</hi> with the title of Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> this <hi>Pope</hi> ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated <hi>a Jubilee</hi> in the year 1600. <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France</hi> himselfe turned <hi>Papist</hi> yet allowed liberty of religion to the reformed Churches in France called <hi>Hugonots.</hi> By this time there was scarcely a Kingdome, or common weale in <hi>Europe</hi> which more or less had not tasted of <hi>Reformation. Sueden, Denmarke,</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> as also <hi>England, Scotland</hi> &amp; <hi>Ireland,</hi> were quite fallen off from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy. In <hi>France,</hi> one part in 3 were <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots.</hi> In <hi>Germany,</hi> one halfe were either <hi>Lutherans, Calvinists,</hi> or <hi>Anababtists.</hi> In <hi>Poland, Lithuania,</hi> &amp; <hi>Prussia,</hi> a fourth part, were reformed. In <hi>Hungaria, Scla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Dacia,</hi> more then halfe seemed to be for the <hi>Reformation.</hi> And so in the <hi>Neth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlands.</hi> The <hi>Moscovites,</hi> &amp; <hi>Greeks</hi> owned no subjection to <hi>Roma,</hi> Only <hi>Italia, Spaine,</hi> &amp; <hi>Portugal</hi> kept Themselves somwhat entyre <hi>Romanists;</hi> So mightily was that mighty Empire by these days diminished. Only in <hi>Austria,</hi> &amp; <hi>Stiria</hi> the Church was under persecution at this time, at the <hi>Popes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, (the allowed, &amp; covenaunted liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being taken away.) In 1603 dyed Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of blessed memory, whom King <hi>James</hi> the 1<seg rend="sup">st</seg>. succeded, and the 3 King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms

                     <note place="margin">Rev. 16, 2.</note> by means of <hi>Noysom and Grievous Sores,</hi> which for many years have befallen them.

But of late years it is remarkable, how strangely this sort of People hath been tormented and vexed with loss and ruin in all their atchievements and dealing, as it were men broken and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed; like unto a man so pestered with botches and boyls, and stinking running sores, that he hath no rest either sleeping or waking.

And the <hi>Tartarian Mahometans</hi> have shared with the <hi>Turks</hi> in all Their noysom and grievous Plagues and Sores. But how far the East Country <hi>Tartarians</hi> and <hi>Persian Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> have tasted of this Wrath, and how it hath fared with the <hi>Arabians</hi> on both sides the Red Sea, and the Straits of <hi>Babel Mandel,</hi> and in the south east countries of <hi>Affrica,</hi> is not yet said, or at least is not come to hand.

Now to find out these <hi>Men of the Earth,</hi> by the <hi>noysom and grievous sores which have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen Them</hi> of late years; It is something strange to be observed and remembred, how the hand of God hath gone out against many Churches of the <hi>reformed religion,</hi> in a circle, one after the other, and all much after the same rate. This Chastisement first began with the Churches of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>Austria.</hi> In the peace of <hi>Germany,</hi> agreed upon at <hi>Munster,</hi> the <hi>Bohemians</hi> and <hi>Austrians</hi> were left to the mercy of an hard Master, who by exile and confiscation of goods,<note place="margin">See the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes of those years <hi>Gallo.

<pb n="405" facs="tcp:204201:245"/> would not become <hi>Papists:</hi> insomuch as those countrys are now become wholly <hi>Popish.</hi> This happened about the year 1650. And within a few years after happened the like calamities in <hi>Piemont,</hi> through the severity of as hard masters there. And within a year or two, the same noysom sores happened in <hi>Poland.</hi> These were terrible persecutions: And yet some half a score years after, as bad or worse afflictions befell the poor <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> whose sores were very noysom and grievous, inasmuch as They spred far and near, and touched many thousands of people. And lastly, the same Chastisement is extended into the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Amos, 3.6.</note> These things <hi>were not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hand of God;</hi> and whether this wrath shall stop here, is best known unto God, who knows the reason of all things. But be it so, as I humbly conceive, (with submission to the wise and learned,) that these afflictions are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of a <hi>Religion savouring of the Earth:</hi> Then God knows how far it will pierce through <hi>all the Churches</hi> where the same religion reigns; and the same way of <hi>Reformation</hi> hath beeen effected. The <hi>Bohemians</hi> and <hi>Austri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> came very honestly by Their <hi>Reformation,</hi> through the preaching of the perfecuted <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dists</hi> driven from <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which was much advanced by the holy lessons brought out of <hi>England</hi> from the holy <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> and taught Them by the painful <hi>John Hus</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> his assistant. But when they took up Arms under the leading of <hi>Zisca</hi> and <hi>Procopius,</hi> and King <hi>Georgius Pogebrachius,</hi> to maintain Their religion by force of arms against <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> and <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> Their sovereign princes.
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:204201:246"/> These practices may be supposed something different from the customes of the <hi>Apostolical</hi> and <hi>Primitive</hi> times:<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1, 3. 1 Pet. 2.13, 14. <hi>and</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21.</note> But yet being carried on with a pure zeal, heated with a detestation of the most vilanous murthers, committed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the most excellently holy Martyrs, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Jerome,</hi> Their painful Preachers; it pleased God much to prosper Their arms against Their invaders, for a long time, of above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years. And thus <hi>pure zeal</hi> seemed to go far in an <hi>Antichristian</hi> practice: for Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> had taught Them the lesson,<note place="margin">Avertin an Boi ariae lib. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>[That the King misbehaving himself, it is in the power of the people to depose Him, and to elect a new king; Because the king holds His pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, honour, wealth and authority of the people.]</hi> And according to this <hi>popish lecture</hi> had They acted, whence it pleased God to bear with Them in so much the more mercy. And yet loe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an hundred years, God seems to call to an account for that thing, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Reformation,</hi> established upon an unhappy foundation; and this after they had made a second attempt of the same nature, when they put by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Their first King, and chose <hi>Frederick</hi> the <hi>pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> in His place, but not back'd with that reason or pure zeal as before in the time of <hi>Sigismund.</hi> The <hi>Piemontiers</hi> and <hi>Polonian</hi> Reformed had also acted much to the same purpose. The <hi>French protestants</hi> had tasted of most barbarous usages for many kings reigns, but especially by the massacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> by authority of King <hi>Charles the ninth,</hi> which drove Them to extreams, that much paliated Their taking up arms for religion: and yet though They prospered so successfully as to
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:204201:246"/> gain many good privileges for the ease of Their religion, loe, at length, it pleased God, that They also suffered: As have also done those of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> But what shall we say? Were these <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches greater sinners than all others; In that they have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered such things? Surely nay, I verily think not: For in case of <hi>Chastisement,</hi> for the most part <hi>judgement begins at the house of God,</hi> and the better the Christians are, so much the quicklyer it pleaseth God to correct them. And the <hi>Chastised</hi> are often <hi>owned for God's belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ones,</hi> while such as escape the rod, must go for <hi>bastards.</hi> And without dispute it may be granted, that the sufferings of the <hi>French Protestants</hi> have been of famous reputation; and it is to be hoped, those of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> and the rest have been the like. And yet the <hi>popularity of the priesthood taking too much upon them,</hi> has been an <hi>heinous</hi> and a <hi>crying sin,</hi> which God hath punished in old time with <hi>greater severity:</hi> And to found a <hi>Reformation</hi> by <hi>Rebellion,</hi> or <hi>Bloudshed,</hi> God hath never favoured: And to lay hands on the <hi>spoil of holy things,</hi> is a mater that hath never prosper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, no not at the <hi>Pagan</hi> temples. In old time the <hi>Levites</hi> who were but a <hi>second order of priesthood,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 16.35, 36, 37.38.</note> had not the authority of <hi>ordering and making priests,</hi> or of putting down <hi>Their</hi> superiors, and when They attempted it, God corrected Them in His wrath. In the Gospel times, the <hi>seventy disciples</hi> had not the gift of <hi>conveying the graces of the Holy Ghost:</hi>

And this beginning in 1559, at such time as <hi>Cromwell's Son</hi> being affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of His throne, the affairs of the <hi>Beast of the Earth</hi> began to reel and totter; it was to hold 41 years, unto the year 1700. And thus was there at once both an <hi>Earthquake</hi> and a <hi>Calm;</hi> or a Calm in the midst of the Earthquake: Or a <hi>Calm</hi> at least in <hi>England,</hi> now called <hi>Heaven,</hi> while the <hi>Earthquake</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by course in all the Earth besides: The <hi>Turks</hi> then invading the <hi>Empire,</hi> and fighting to gain <hi>Candia; Tassaletta,</hi> invading the <hi>Moors:</hi> The <hi>French</hi> overrunning the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>French</hi> furiously battering each other; And so the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Suedes;</hi> And soon after 1680, King <hi>Charles</hi> dying, <hi>Popery</hi> got footting again in <hi>Heaven,</hi> (viz. in <hi>England:</hi>) And while it was yet beginning to disturb, was shook out again.

Now in this appearance of the Vision, The Angel of the waters said, <hi>[Thou art righteous O Lord, which art, and which wast, and shalt be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Thou hast judged thus: For They have shed the bloud of Saints,</hi>

And the Angel of the <hi>Altar</hi> who answered, seems to be some holy <hi>Arch-bishop,</hi> or the <hi>other Witness</hi> of God, who alternately joyns with His prince in these holy services of the praise of God.

This race of kings hath also of many years been feudatory to the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and they have been very zealous and stiff maintainers of his Blasphemies, and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.

Whence there have been many supernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merary Emperors, but not above 41 true Ones. And most probable it is, that the 42d.
